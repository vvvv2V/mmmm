# 2. Set these variables in your hosting platform:
#    - Vercel: Settings → Environment Variables
#    - Railway: Variables tab
#    - Netlify: Build & Deploy → Environment
# 3. Use different API URLs for staging vs production
# 4. Rotate Stripe keys periodically
# 5. Monitor error logs in Sentry dashboard
